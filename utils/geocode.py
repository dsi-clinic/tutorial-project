    """Geocodes an address using the Mapbox API

    A variety of formats for addresses work here since the Mapbox API is pretty
    smart with how it parses stuff. You can, for example, give a specific
    address or you can give only a city like "Chicago"

    Args:
        street: Street address (ie 123 Fake Street)
        city: City name
        state: State name. This can be the full state name or the abbreviation
        zip: Zip code. This must be a string!

    Returns:
        A tuple of latitude and longitude. These are returned as floats. For
        example:
        (-41.8781, 87.6298)."""
